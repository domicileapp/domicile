# Notes

Random thoughts on direction for the project to be organized later

## Release Schedule

I'm really not certain about a release schedule at this point.
I imagine at first, the release schedule should be fairly frequent, but
I no idea what best practices are here. I have not really worked on a team
that releases software in this particular way before as I am more on the
infrastructure side of the house. Presumably the `next` branch gets released
fairly often...once a week? once a day? Also factoring in the upgrade methods
if folks are running this on Docker or Kubernetes clusters, that might be annoying.

## Technology and Tooling Rationale

This project's purpose is partially because I will find it useful, and partially
as a learning experience for me.

### Nest.js

Honestly, I just really like Nest.js from what I've done with it so far, and just
want to get a bit more comfortable with it. Other considered backend/api options included
Python (Django) and Go (Gin?).

### React

Previous projects have been exclusively in Vue.js, and React has a signifigant market
share and I've never had the opportunity to use or learn it. Like what I see so far!
It's also very popular and that makes it easier for others to contribute if they want.

I am very weak in design and could really use some assistance in this area.

### Kubernetes

Pretty much see above. Have not had many professional opportunities to use this, and I
would like to. Eventually I see a full helm chart option. **However, I feel strongly about
maintaining a Docker (compose) version as not everyone wants or needs a k8s cluster**. I
have found it a bit frustrating when other projects ONLY offer self-hosting on a Kubernetes
cluster.

I understand this may impact some architecture choices, but honestly can't really
see this needing the more advanced features k8s offers as theoretically it should be a fairly
simple CRUD app with thoughtful defaults for people with executive disfunction.
